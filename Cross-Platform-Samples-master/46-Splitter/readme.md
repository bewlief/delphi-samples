The Splitter Demo is a great way to show how to use the splitter control to segment two different sections of the app. You can easily resize the sections by dragging the splitter control. This is a great way to allow users to customize their interface to their liking. The Splitter Demo is cross-platform application built in Delphi using a single code base and single UI for Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux.
