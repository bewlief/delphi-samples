IMPORTANT!!!
------------

You cannot use the CGI or DLL compiled with 
Personal or Single-USer Edition of Absolute Database,
as the database file is accessed in multi-user mode and 
the nag-screen is shown.

Please download the compiled DLL and CGI from
http://www.componentace.com/data/distr/websqlconsole.zip

To try this DLL or CGI, place it into your web server
scripts directory.  
Then place Demos.abs file from ...\AbsoluteDatabase\Demos\Data\Demos.abs
to the scripts directory.

You can then access the DLL/CGI application
from a web browser using http://<your web server>/scripts/iserver.dll
or http://<your web server>/scripts/iserver.exe
