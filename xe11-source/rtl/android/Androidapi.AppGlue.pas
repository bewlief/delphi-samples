unit Androidapi.AppGlue;

{ Please note that this unit exports "ANativeActivity_onCreate" method, which will be executed automatically
  when Android Native Activity starts. During initial execution of this code, none of RTL or "System.pas"
  functions are available, which includes but not limited to exception handling, locale-related compare and
  threading. Therefore, such code may only use basic language constructs and rely exclusively on "libc"
  functions provided in Bionic. This may include some Androidapi.* and Posix.* units, but special care is
  to be taken to make sure that the required functionality is properly implemented.

  If you make any changes/additions to the code herein, it must be reviewed by the senior team members prior to
  committing to the repository. Be prepared to fully defend and explain the changes, why they are necessary and
  what problem it is purporting to solve. Any violation of the parameters by which changes may be made to this
  unit will result in the outright rejection of the proposed changes. Proceed with extreme caution. }
